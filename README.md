I have worked in multiple roles supporting business IT infrastructures. During my time filling these multiple roles PowerShell has been my language of choice for efficiency and effectiveness. 

### AdminToolbox
The [Admintoolbox](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/AdminToolbox) repository is a collection of modules for my publicly shared functions and tools. The following modules are included.

- [x] ActiveDirectory
- [x] EndpointManagement
- [x] Exchange
- [x] FFTools
- [x] FileManagement
- [x] FortiWizard
- [x] Fun
- [x] Networking
- [x] Office365
- [x] Remoting
- [x] VmwareAutomate

### PSPortable
Addiotnally I have created two portable PowerShell packages in the [PSPortable](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/PSPortable) and [PSPortableLight](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/PSPortableLight) repositories. Those repositories present a portable PowerShell 7 package with multiple included modules. They can be downloaded using a single command and used right away. The idea behind this is you can maintain the same PowerShell environment across many servers with change tracking.
