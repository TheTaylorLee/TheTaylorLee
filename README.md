### PSPortable
Addiotnally I have created two portable PowerShell packages in the [PSPortable](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/PSPortable) and [PSPortableLight](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/PSPortableLight) repositories. Those repositories present a portable PowerShell 7 package with multiple included modules. They can be downloaded using a single command and used right away. The idea behind this is you can maintain the same PowerShell environment across many servers with change tracking.
